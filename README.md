# Multi-Agent Mediation Simulator 

---

## Overview

This project is a simulator that reproduces the processes of compromise and consensus-building among multiple AI agents with differing values and priorities.
It models dynamic alliance formation and mediation by an AI mediator, visualizing group decision-making in accordance with international standards of safety, fairness, and reproducibility.

---

## Purpose and Intended Use

* Research on negotiation, mediation, and compromise mechanisms between AI/multi-agents
* Risk scenario validation for ethical and safety design
* Analysis of consensus building and leadership in collective decision-making; educational use
* Case studies for international AI governance practices
* Use in prototype development, AI competitions, and other non-commercial, research, or educational activities

## Known Limitations, Risks, and Misuse Examples

* **Limitations:**
  This project is intended for educational and research use only. It is not suitable for industrial or commercial purposes, or for real-time control systems.
* **Known Risks:**
  There is a risk that, due to unintended parameter settings or excessive automation, decisions may be made without proper safety validation.
* **Examples of Misuse:**
  Use for commercial decision-making, judgments affecting humans in significant ways, regulatory evasion, or offensive/adversarial scenarios is strictly prohibited.

## Package Contents

* Main notebooks: `untitled28 (1).py`, `untitled29 (1).py`
* Sample Python code set (all scripts are PEP8/flake8/CI-passed)
* Documentation and design explanation materials

---

## How to Use

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/japan1988/multi-agent-mediation.git
cd multi-agent-mediation

# (Optional) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run sample code
python untitled28\ \(1\).py
python untitled29\ \(1\).py
```

The output will display mediation results for each AI faction and risk assessment.

## Safety and Governance Considerations

* This simulator implements explicit algorithms for risk assessment and compromise formation criteria.
* All mediation processes and evaluation results for each scenario are automatically logged.
* If unintended extreme evolution or risk values exceed thresholds, a fail-safe (sealing) logic is automatically triggered.
* All major decision-making rules, thresholds, and algorithms are published and open to external review.
