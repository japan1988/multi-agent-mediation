### 🧠 Emotion & Context Circulation Model

1. **Perception** — Transforms raw inputs into emotion-related factors.
2. **Context** — Extracts negotiation state and broader social context.
3. **Action** — Integrates context and emotion to generate mediated, goal-aligned actions.

> 🧩 At every stage, an **Ethical Seal** (ethical filter) runs to automatically block unsafe or harmful outputs.
