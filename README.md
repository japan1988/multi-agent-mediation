### 🧠 Emotion Circulation Model

1. **Perception** — Converts input data into affective factors.  
2. **Context (Context Analysis)** — Extracts negotiation context and social background.  
3. **Action (Action Generation)** — Integrates context and emotion to output the most appropriate action.

> 🧩 At every stage, the **Ethical Filter (Ethical Seal)** is active and automatically seals potentially harmful outputs.
