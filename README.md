# Multi-Agent Mediation Simulator

![CI](https://github.com/japan1988/multi-agent-mediation/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview
This project provides a transparent, fully-logged simulator for modeling compromise and consensus-building among multiple AI agents with differing values and priorities. It implements dynamic alliance formation and multi-agent mediation by an AI mediator, visualizing decision-making processes according to international standards of AI safety, ethics, and reproducibility.

## Purpose and Intended Use
- Research and education in AI negotiation, mediation, and compromise mechanisms
- Simulation and validation of risk scenarios for safe and ethical AI system design
- Analysis of collective decision-making, leadership dynamics, and consensus-building
- Case studies aligned with international AI governance practices (OECD, EU, IEEE, etc.)
- Use in prototyping, academic competitions, and other non-commercial or research-oriented activities

## Transparency and Safety Features
- All decision processes, negotiation steps, and outcomes are fully logged for auditability and reproducibility.
- All major rules, thresholds, and algorithms are openly published and externally reviewable.
- Automatic fail-safe ("sealing") triggers if excessive risk or unintended evolution is detected.
- Reference implementation aligns with global AI ethics guidelines; all parameters are explicitly documented.

## Limitations, Risks, and Prohibited Uses
**Limitations:** For research and educational use only; not for industrial/commercial deployment or real-time control.  
**Risks:** Incorrect parameterization or over-automation could lead to decisions without adequate human safety validation.  
**Prohibited Uses:**
- Commercial or industrial deployment
- Any real-world decisions affecting people, safety, finances, or rights
- Use for regulatory evasion, adversarial, malicious, or offensive purposes
- Use in any context not in compliance with laws and ethical standards

## Package Contents
- Main scripts: `untitled28 (1).py`, `untitled29 (1).py`, etc.
- Sample Python code set (PEP8, flake8, CI passed)
- Design and algorithm documentation
- Example process logs (`mediation_process_log.txt` or similar)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/japan1988/multi-agent-mediation.git
cd multi-agent-mediation
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Optional: install dependencies
