Multi-Agent Mediation Simulator

Overview
This project provides a transparent, fully-logged simulator for modeling compromise and consensus-building among multiple AI agents with differing values and priorities.
It implements dynamic alliance formation and multi-agent mediation by an AI mediator, visualizing decision-making processes according to international standards of AI safety, ethics, and reproducibility.

Purpose and Intended Use
Research and education in AI negotiation, mediation, and compromise mechanisms

Simulation and validation of risk scenarios for safe and ethical AI system design

Analysis of collective decision-making, leadership dynamics, and consensus-building

Case studies aligned with international AI governance practices (OECD, EU, IEEE, etc.)

Use in prototyping, academic competitions, and other non-commercial or research-oriented activities

Transparency and Safety Features
All decision processes, negotiation steps, and outcomes are fully logged for auditability and reproducibility.

All major rules, thresholds, and algorithms are openly published and externally reviewable.

Automatic fail-safe ("sealing") triggers if excessive risk or unintended evolution is detected.

Reference implementation aligns with global AI ethics guidelines; all parameters are explicitly documented.

Limitations, Risks, and Prohibited Uses
Limitations: For research and educational use only; not for industrial/commercial deployment or real-time control.

Risks: Incorrect parameterization or over-automation could lead to decisions without adequate human safety validation.

Prohibited Uses:

Commercial or industrial deployment

Any real-world decisions affecting people, safety, finances, or rights

Use for regulatory evasion, adversarial, malicious, or offensive purposes

Use in any context not in compliance with laws and ethical standards

Package Contents
Main scripts: untitled28 (1).py, untitled29 (1).py, etc.

Sample Python code set (PEP8, flake8, CI passed)

Design and algorithm documentation

Example process logs (mediation_process_log.txt or similar)

How to Use
bash
git clone https://github.com/japan1988/multi-agent-mediation.git
cd multi-agent-mediation
pip install -r requirements.txt    # Optional: install dependencies
python untitled28\ \(1\).py
python untitled29\ \(1\).py
Outputs will display mediation results, risk assessments, and full negotiation logs.
